# Hardhat Fund Me Project

## Introduction
This project is a vital part of my learning journey with Patrick Collins' course, focusing on building a fundraising application using the Hardhat framework. My name is Andrei Yazepchyk, and through this project, I have gained substantial knowledge and practical experience in blockchain development.

## Project Overview
The "Fund Me" project leverages Hardhat to create a fundraising platform. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of Ethereum blockchain development, including the use of Chainlink, contract deployment, testing, and understanding the nuances of different network environments.

### Key Features
- **Fundraising Application**: Allows users to raise funds in a decentralized environment.
- **Chainlink Integration**: Utilizes Chainlink for reliable oracle services.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Demonstrates the use of Hardhat for testing and deploying smart contracts.
- **Mocking**: Implements mocks to simulate external contract interactions.
- **Network Differences**: Educates on the differences between local and testing networks.

### Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in building and interacting with smart contracts.
- Learned to use Chainlink for external data fetching in smart contracts.
- Mastered the art of writing and running tests for smart contract verification.
- Acquired skills in deploying contracts to various Ethereum networks using Hardhat.
- Understood the concept of Mocks and their applications in contract testing.
